This repository is an unofficial implementation of Avalanche Detection paper [Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Monitoring of Avalanche Activity: An Automated Detection Scheme](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317345580_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_SAR_Monitoring_of_Avalanche_Activity_An_Automated_Detection_Scheme) by H. Vickers, M. Eckerstorfer, E. Malnes, and A. Doulgeris. The code was executed to reproduce the results described in the paper.

## Introduction
Snow avalanches are a recurring hazard in Troms county, threatening recreational users, property, and transportation networks. Traditional field-based monitoring methods are limited in their temporal and spatial extent, particularly in remote areas and during high-danger periods. Technological advancements have enabled the observation and mapping of avalanche activity using SAR technology, which is independent of light and weather conditions.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Akshaykk12/AvalancheWatch
```
```
cd ./AvalancheWatch
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Results

The revised algorithm shows improved performance over the previous version, particularly in areas with varying snow conditions. The number of false positives is significantly reduced, leading to more accurate avalanche detection results.
